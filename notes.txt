Approach an interview like you are going to go snowboarding with a group 
of people for the first time.  

  Here to have fun and get things done.
  Confident in your abilities.  
  An equal.  

Approach the part time aspect like you have to leave at a certain time for 
other responsibilities.  

  This is how it is.  
  Make the most of the time we have to get things done.
  It won't impact the rest of our experience.
