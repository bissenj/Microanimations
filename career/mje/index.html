Early on there are usually lots of errors encountered and this is a great time to build out how errors in production will work.  How should a user get notified?  What happens when an error occurs…when does the user get notified?  Can they proceed and come back to fix it later?  Basically during testing I’m walking through the product and paying attention to what feels right, and what feels clunky and needs re-working.

Part of the fun in building software is creatively blending the IT domain with the business domain.  For example, in a previous project mentioned on this site, Field Time Entry, the requirements were to create a timesheet, in the IT world this is basically a table with some numeric values to add up.  Not too different from an excel spreadsheet.  For the user however, this was entering Project Management data, and Payroll data for the current and previous week.  Generally this needed to be accomplished by a specific deadline, and there were a myriad of other taks that needed to be accomplished at the same time.  The users were on a jobsite with life threatening hazards (extreme voltage,   heavy equipment, lots of people to supervise) so the software needed to be as easy as possible to understanding and navigate.  By thinking like a user, rather than copy the prior version of the software which only showed users a single day view,  I created a home screen for the product which showed the prior and current weeks and clearly laid out what hours were entered and submitted for each day of the week, and what work was left to be done.  This was something helpful the users did not have visibility to before and overall it led to the product being well recieved.  Hopefully it even improved the quality of the users work since they did not have to wrestle with their timekeeping software, as much.',

Each web app had a different style and level of polish and some were confusing to use.  There was also a lack of branding on the apps.  Creating a standard design template for our web apps not only improved the look the apps but also allowed us to add in features like a consistent help messages (who do i call and what is the number?), a version history and release notes screen (these are the new features and bug fixes that you asked for), and internal branding (like an employee uniform, but on software).',

Waiting for users to call in tickets to the help desk and then responding reactively is not an ideal approach to software quality or our relationship with our users.  It’s unlikely that all software bugs would get reported, and usually our business users could be spending their time better than calling in issues with our software.  Idealy we as software developers and supporters should know when our users are having issues with our software and a logging and error handling framework helps with that.
