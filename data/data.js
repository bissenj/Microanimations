Years later in high school I took my first official computer programming classes and things started to click. </p><p>  In college I switched majors from engineering to computer science after I realized I enjoy seeing the result of my work at the end of the day, and I wasnt getting that from my engineering classes.  That theme carried into my career starting as an IT generalist and gradually moving towards the front end where I find meaning in organizing and presenting information in a visually pleasing manner. <p>Click around to see where my career has taken me.</p>',

        story: 'I graduated with a degree in Computer Science and a focus on Software Engineering.  I guess I felt the need to prove myself at that age so I took the hardest engineering software, math and science classes I could.  College taught me how to work in groups and that sometimes you need to step up and lead the group in order to get things done.  At one point I also had three W2 jobs and a paying gig job as the drummer in a cover band.  At the time I was uncomfortable with the idea of being in debt out of college.  If I could go back in time and redo the whole experience, I would make myself slow down and relax a bit.  On the upside I came away with my future wife, 8 close friends I still hang out with, several job offers, and learned to snowboard. <p>While in college I interned at Avista, an avaiation software testing and development company. </p>'

        story: "<p>I worked on the Web Development team developing in-house apps in Asp.Net and Javascript.  Typically I worked on front end development, improving UI/UX, building web prototypes to hand off to other developers, building mockups in Adobe XD to help communication between project stake holders, mentoring less experienced team members, and working with the team to mature the development environment through enhancing our process and tools, .</p><div class='aside'><p><div class='heading'>Brief side note:  A wild ride</div>Our dev team 'competed' within the company against 3rd party products.  If we could build something cheaper and better, the rest of the company would use our product, but if not, then the 3rd party product would be brought in-house.  One successful example was our 'Time tracking application' for the field work force where we quickly developed a prototype which was chosen by company leadership over commercial products.  Our production product turned out to be well received by our end users as it saved them time and made their jobs easier.  Some of my contributions on that project (3 person dev team) were the UI/UX design, handling user rollout, training and feedback, and presenting the end product to company leadership [...and full stack development, testing, deployments, handling issues, light project management,  coordinating with our 3rd developer who worked nights, etc...]</p></div> <p>I enjoyed a lot of my time here.  I re-learned I really enjoy coding and the software development process and found my niche in Front End work.  I added value by taking my experience in a larger IT department and adding some maturity to our small dev team.  This maturity helped improve our ability to deliver to and support our end users.  Examples of this are helping design and implement our release process [agile development, git branching strategy, version numbering, backout plans, etc] which added predictability and stability to our software releases.  I also envisioned and helped create a reuseable logging framework for not only tracking issues but also tracking app useage (so we knew in real time if anyone was in the system) and KPI data (so we knew if people were actually using our systems and getting the value the systems were designed for).  A prime example of the benefit of our logging system was being able to notice system issues and proactively calling our end users to help them rather than waiting until they called the issue into our help desk.  We didn’t do this all the time, but for mission critical tasks, especially during app rollouts, it improved our relationship with our end users and improved system adoption.</p>"

        story: "In 2021, we sold our business and our family packed up and moved to Montana.  It was a well planned but not straight forward journey.  On our kids first day of school in Montana, we were living out of our camper in an RV park (memories!).  Our house was delayed, so for a number of months we were renting a small townhome and trying to unpack as few boxes as possible.  Most of our house stuff was sold to cut down on moving expenses since we couldn’t find a moving company who would move us 1600 miles from ‘small town in the middle of nowhere’ to another ‘small town in the middle of nowhere’.  Eventually our house was ready and we moved in fully in early 2022.  <p> This move had been our goal since 2012.  We worked HARD and saved for years and finally achieved our goal.  It has been awesome.  No regrets.<p><p>***</p><p>Many people switch careers at some point in their life, sometimes going as far as heading back to college.  Some people are lucky enough to take a sabbatical or two in their work life.  I chose to use this time to refine and expand my skills by setting aside 20 hours a week to work on the IT knowledge I didn’t have time for when working full time.   For example: </p><ul><li>I spent some time learning native Android programming in Kotlin.  While in my career days I could create a web app that looked and functioned like an App, I felt the browser was too limiting. </li><li>I brushed up on my .Net  as it has changed considerably since college and I wanted to see that evolution and what is possible now.</li><li>I dove deeper into React, experimenting with Next JS and eventually building full stack projects with Remix.  Once I was comfortable where I was at with React, I moved to React Native and have been really happy with the developer experience React and React Native provide.  </li></ul><p>Currently I am open for part time employment.  I’m looking to fill about 1000 hours / year as a part time employee or as a contractor.   If you want to discuss more, please reach out.</p><p>Thanks for reading,</p><p>John</p>"
